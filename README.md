# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## **Overview of Project**

Based on the data, there are several categories for the entertainment industry, there can be seen the names of the kickstarters that want to be founded with their respective brief description and some information that can be helpful during the data analysis.

### This project includes:
- Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart: "Theater" Category
- Outcomes Based on Goals Chart: "Plays" subcategory
- A written analysis of the results


### **Purpose**
Visualize data to analize in order to get the best investing time in the creation of a new kickstarter. In this case, the first point is to show information regarding the outcomes in the "Theater" category using launch dates and goals so there could be some useful data that can show what was asked to get the best dates to publish this kind of kickstarters. Also, in the goals section can be analized the probable best goal to set in future kickstarters of the same genre, but on the specific "plays" subcategory.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
Possible challenges and problems will be due to *lack of knowledge* of code names for the formulas or forgetting basic material that is necessary to complete the task. Fortunately, there are plenty of sties with the information that will be needed in order to finish the challenge according the specifications. The one that will be used is: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-video-training-9bc05390-e94c-46af-a5b3-d7c22f6990bb?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us .

Something that is a must that has to be considered is that, due to previous editions to the file, it can be difficult to manage due to the system capacity, despite the computer specs.

### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: "Theater" Category**

Graph presented for analysis:
<img src=https://github.com/LennethNova/Challenge_01_Excel_Kicktarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png></img>

As is observed in the graph, the most successful time to publish a Kickstarter for the Theater category is in May and the least recommended month to publish a kickstarter for this category is December. While there may be a close relation of failure in January, July and October, seems that October is one of the critical months to face failure at the moment of publishing a Kickstarter in the Theater category; and in April is the month that can face least failure. In case of the Canceled ones, seems that the canceled outcomes gets to it's peak in July and then in October seems that few kickstarters got cancelled. Also should be noted that September is not so much recommended to start a kicksarter due to the slight difference between success and failure.

Using this graph, there seems to be a tendency where can be observed that May is the month with the most balanced points between successful, failure and canceled. 


### **Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: "Plays" subcategory**
Graph presented for analysis:
<img src=https://github.com/LennethNova/Challenge_01_Excel_Kicktarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png></img>

This graph represents the Outcomes based on goals for the "Plays" subcategory and shows that the most succesful Kickstarter where the ones that where the goal was lower and the ones that failed were when the goal was higher. Even though, there were 4 out of 6 that succeded despite having a higher goal (40,000 to 44,999). As observed in the graph and also de percentages, the goals above $20,000 start to decline in success, while the goals below that sums of money are likely to succed. Also, the mid point for setting a goal for this subcategory is around $15,000 to $29,999 since there is a 50-50 chance that a kickstarter can or cannot reach its goal.

### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**
The file starts to have a big size in MegaBytes and funny enough starts to use more resources from the computer. One of the most obnoxious one is the constant *"Not Responding"* message that appears usually when changing from sheets. That message makes the program crash, fortunately saving a file several times allows to never lose the data.

## **Results**

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    May is one of the best dates to start a Kickstarter in the "Theater" category and  July and October are not such as good for those kind of kickstarters due to possible failure.
Even though, the most successful date is May, the month that has more Theater Kickstarters is July. The top three months with more theatrical kickstarters would be: July, May and Jun.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    The Kickstarters from the subcategory "Plays" are likely to succed if the goal is set at around $15,000 or less.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    More information in regard of the ones that succed and the ones that don't despite the goals, such as the director, the actors and the knowledge and interest of the potential market.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - The goals and pleadges for every category and subcategory.
    - Comparing success in a Category for each country.
    - Knowledge of preferences in every category by year and by country.

##### Notes: #####

- "Parent category" name changed to "Category" for better personal reference.
- Excel file is extremely heavy to handle with all the previous data that was added. My computer crashed a several times due to it.
- Used different colors in order to give it format.
- Used the save as picture feature that you can get by right clicking the images. 
- The month in the Row Label was created by selecting the first row below and right-click to group, after that just selecting months that was what was needed.
- Some Markups in this file may be from HTML.
